# vue-the-aviator

> A Vue.js project

## Heads up!

1. If you were npm-linking `vue-threejs`, don't forget to link `three`, so there won't be confusing stuffs happened (instanceof not working, threejs-inspector [went into a debugger](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejs-inspector/issues/26), etc). `vue-threejs` should try to handle it as well.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
